- You DO NOT need any prior Backend Development knowledge!

##  Description

**Just released with all new NodeJS best practices and trends for 2023! Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by industry experts that have actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto with Node.js.**

Using the latest version of Node, this course is focused on efficiency and turning you into a Back End or Fullstack developer. Never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete tutorials anymore! **Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Facebook, + other top tech companies for a reason.**

We guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online resource on NodeJS. This project based course will introduce you to all of the modern toolchain of a Node JS developer in 2023. Along the way, we will build a massive NASA Space launch application using Node.js, Express Framework, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, and much more! This is going to be a Fullstack MERN app. We will also build many other mini projects along the way so you feel confident deploying any Node.js project to production in the future by yourself!

**All code is going to be provided step by step and even if you don’t like to code along, you will get access to all the code from the projects we build so anyone signed up for the course will have their own project to put on their portfolio right away.**

The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of releasing a professional (performant and secure) Node.js project all the way into production. We will start from the very beginning by teaching you Node basics and then going into advanced topics so you can make good decisions on architecture and tools on any of your future NodeJS projects. The goal is to turn you into a senior backend developer!

Finally, this course will be constantly evolving and updating as the landscape changes. Just as the Node ecosystem evolves, we want **this course to be constantly updated with lectures and resource for you to come back to, in order to find the latest Node best practices anytime in the future.**

**Taught By:**

**Andrei Neagoie** is the instructor of the **highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing.** His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life. 

Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. P**rogramming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.**   Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. 

Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. **He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.** 

Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.

**Adam** is one of the instructors at Zero To Mastery, one of the highest rated and fastest growing software development academies on Udemy. He has been working as a senior software developer for many years and has worked for some of the top companies in the world with revenues exceeding $50 billion. Now, Adam aims to instil his students with his **love for learning and development**, while helping them achieve real world success that extends far beyond the completion of his courses.

Adam walks the walk when it comes to building applications that are secure, scalable, and performant and he is going to share his expertise with you to **show you how real world systems are built.** He understands what it’s like to go from “hello world” to large scale production deployments and promises to take you on that very same journey. Courses should teach practical skills that are current and should **lay a foundation** for a future in this incredible and exciting industry. And, having started as a self-taught developer, Adam knows the overwhelming feeling of not knowing where to begin, and the importance of learning from the best available sources.

Drawing from his deep experience, Adam’s courses will show you that you don’t need to spend tens of thousands of dollars to **take your flourishing skills into the real world and make a difference.**

**See you inside the course!**
