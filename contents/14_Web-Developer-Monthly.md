# 14. Web Developer Monthly

Web Developer Monthly: Every month, I accumulate all of the best resources and articles, as well as free resources around the web for Web Developers. It gets read by 100,000+ web developers. If you want to stay up to date with the industry and make sure you don't miss any important news, you can check out the monthly newsletter here. [It's completely free every month](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/?tag=WDM&utm_source=udemy&utm_medium=coursecontent#monthly)!

There is also the Machine Learning Monthly (written by Daniel Bourke) and Python Monthly if you are interested which you can find [here](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/?utm_source=udemy&utm_medium=coursecontent#monthly).
