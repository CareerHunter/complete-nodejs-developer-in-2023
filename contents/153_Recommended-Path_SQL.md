# 153. Recommended Path: SQL

This is exciting! In the next videos we're going to explore two main categories of databases: SQL and NoSQL and choose which one to use for our project. Because our students come from all kinds of different backgrounds, we've provided some additional material on SQL databases.

If you aren't familiar with databases, or haven't used SQL databases before, jump over to the **Appendix: SQL** section. In this section you'll get a strong foundation in SQL databases. This knowledge will help you make the decision on which database to use together with us in the next videos!

Otherwise, let's continue with our comparison of NoSQL with SQL!
