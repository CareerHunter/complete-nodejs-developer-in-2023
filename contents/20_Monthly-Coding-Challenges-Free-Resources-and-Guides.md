# 20. Monthly Coding Challenges, Free Resources and Guides

Every month in the community, we will have [coding challenges](https://zerotomastery.io/community/coding-challenges/) for you to participate in, [monthly industry blogs](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/) and other [top free resources](https://zerotomastery.io/resources/) emailed to you. We also have annual events like Advent of Code🎄, Hacktoberfest 👾, and Frosty February Hackathon☃️, plus some giveaways 🎁 as well.

Make sure you have your email settings on Udemy to allow this, as every month we will be emailing you a community update email where we list all of the new challenges, free resources, videos and giveaways.

Some students have mentioned they do not receive these emails and it's mainly because of this (Go to Your profile Icon and click: **Account > Notification Settings**). Make sure you have these 2 boxes checked if you want to receive the monthly email like in the image below.
