**ChatGPT:** JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used to make interactive and dynamic web pages. The JavaScript engine is the component of the web browser or JavaScript runtime environment that interprets and executes JavaScript code.

Here are some of the most popular JavaScript engines:

1. V8: Developed by Google, V8 is the JavaScript engine that is used in Google Chrome and the open-source browser engine Chromium.
2. Spider Monkey: Developed by Mozilla, Spider Monkey is the JavaScript engine that is used in the Mozilla Firefox browser.
3. Chakra: Developed by Microsoft, Chakra is the JavaScript engine that is used in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.
4. JavaScriptCore: Developed by Apple, JavaScriptCore is the JavaScript engine that is used in the Safari web browser.
5. Nitro: Developed by WebKit, Nitro is the JavaScript engine that was used in the Safari web browser before JavaScriptCore was introduced.

Each JavaScript engine has its own strengths and weaknesses, and they may implement JavaScript differently, leading to different performance characteristics and capabilities.
