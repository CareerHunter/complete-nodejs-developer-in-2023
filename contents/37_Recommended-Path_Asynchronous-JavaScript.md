# 37. Recommended Path: Asynchronous JavaScript

Phew! We just learned a lot about Node's deep internals! More than most developers ever learn! Our understanding of how Node works under the covers will give us a leg up in the more practical coding sections of the course that are coming up. Before we apply what we've learned, because some students taking the course have more experience with asynchronous JavaScript, we have 2 paths to pick from to accommodate everyone:

1. If you aren't too familiar with the latest asynchronous JavaScript features, head on over to **Appendix: Asynchronous JavaScript** to get familiar with how what we've learned applies to JavaScript code. Once you are done with that section, come back here and continue with the course!

2. If you have already worked extensively with asynchronous Javascript, Promises, and async / await, you can **ignore** the Appendix: Asynchronous JavaScript section and head on over to the next section where we learn how to use Node modules!
