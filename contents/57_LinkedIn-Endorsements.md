# 57. LinkedIn Endorsements

If you are looking to improve your LinkedIn profile and have others endorse your skills, we have a private ZTM [LinkedIn group here](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12121940/). LinkedIn allows you to have recruiters message you with lots of job opportunities. You can **join the group by clicking on "LinkedIn Group"** and then go ahead and endorse some of the member's skills (other people will do the same for you as they join).

If you have any questions, reach out in our private Discord chat community in the **#job-hunting** channel!

**UPDATE!!! Zero to Mastery is officially a recognized school!** What does this mean for you? It means that you can add it as an educational institution on LinkedIn as part of your profile to wow those employers (as your education history). [Check it out here](https://www.linkedin.com/school/64685953/). To add it to your profile:



Step 1: Go to personal LinkedIn profile

Step 2: Scroll down to the Education section

Step 3: Click the +

Step 4: Type in **Zero To Mastery Academy**
