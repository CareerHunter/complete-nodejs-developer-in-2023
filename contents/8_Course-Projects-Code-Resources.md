# 8. Course Projects + Code + Resources

**CHEATSHEET:**

We have also created a [NODEJS cheatsheet](https://zerotomastery.io/cheatsheets/node-js-cheat-sheet?utm_source=udemy&utm_medium=coursecontent) for you to use throughout the course (or to remember important concepts from the course).

You can find all of the course projects and code at the below repositories. Don't worry, we will link to them at the beginning of each project section as well :)
